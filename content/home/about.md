# About me

I am a Postdoctoral Scientist at Georgetown Univeristy with the Shark Bay Dolphin Research Project. I recently obtained my Ph.D. in Biology studying the social and behavioral responses to environmental stressors in bottlenose dolphins (*Tursiops aduncus*) in Shark Bay, Australia while working with Dr. Janet Mann.

I am interested in how animals behaviorally respond to various stressors (both natural and anthropogenic), specifically in the marine environment. I hope to use science to better inform conservation and animal welfare policies. I also have a strong interest in data science with over 5 years of experience with R.
