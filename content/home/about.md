# About me

I am a Postdoctoral Fellow at Georgetown Univeristy with the Shark Bay Dolphin Research Project. I recently obtained my Ph.D. in Biology studying the social and behavioral responses to environmental stressors in bottlenose dolphins (*Tursiops aduncus*) in Shark Bay, Australia while working with Dr. Janet Mann.

I am interested in using science to better inform conservation and animal welfare policies. I also have a strong interest in data science with 5 years of experience with R. I am currently based in both Washington, D.C. and Chapel Hill, N.C.
