# About me

I am a Post-Doctoral Fellow at Georgetown Univeristy with the Shark Bay Dolphin Research Project. I recently obtained my Ph.D. in Biology working with Dr. Janet Mann where I studied the social and behavioral responses to environmental stressors in bottlenose dolphins (*Tursiops aduncus*) in Shark Bay, Australia.

I am interested in using science to better inform conservation and animal welfare policies. I also enjoy working with complex data in R.  I am currently based in both Washington, D.C. and Durham, N.C.
